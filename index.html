                <p class="margin"><strong>Responsive</strong>  Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development 
                    should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size,
                    platform and orientation.Responsive sites don't just change their layout between breakpoints, 
                    they are built on flexible grids. A flexible grid means that you don't need to target every possible device size that there is, 
                    and build a pixel perfect layout for it. That approach would be impossible given the vast number of differently-sized devices that exist, 
                    and the fact that on desktop at least, people do not always have their browser window maximized.
                </p>
                <p class="margin">By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and change the design at 
                    the point where the content starts to look bad.
                     For example, if the line lengths become unreadably long as the screen size increases, 
                    or a box becomes squashed with two words on each line as it narrows.
                </p> 

                <p class="margin">There are obvious downsides to this approach. The image might be displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, 
                    which is a waste of bandwidth — a mobile user may be downloading an image several times the size of 
                    what they actually see in the browser window. In addition, you may not want the same image aspect ratio on mobile as on desktop. 
                    For example, it might be nice to have a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop. 
                    Or, acknowledging the smaller size of an image on mobile you might want to show a different image altogether, 
                    one which is more easily understood at a small screen size. 
                    These things can't be achieved by scaling down an image.
                </p>
                <p class="margin">Responsive web design ensures that your website does not look the same, 
                    no matter who your visitors are. It makes the site look and works as it should, 
                    in every way that it is attractive to all users. 
                    The simplest approach to responsive images was as described in Marcotte's early articles on responsive design. 
                    Basically, you would take an image that was at the largest size that might be needed, 
                    and scale it down. This is still an approach used today, and in most stylesheets.
